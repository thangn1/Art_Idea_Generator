# <a href='artideagenerator.netlify.app'>Art Idea Generator<a>

### The purpose of this app was to help inspire creative thinking for human-made art using random color generation and AI prompt generation.
It works by generating an idea for an artwork based on selected categories, either from a default list of choices or the user's inputted interest. It then uses ChatGPT to generate an idea of what to draw/paint/create art about.<br>
It also generates a random color (by choosing 3 random values [0,255] for (red, green, blue)), as well as corresponding colors based on color theory. <br><br>
Given a random (tailored to your interests) art prompt and random (but matching) colors, you can come up with plenty of ideas for your next masterful art piece.
These are meant to stimulate your creative brain to create something beautiful and truly unique from randomness.<br><br>
It uses artificial intelligence text generation (from OpenAI) and color palette generation (from thecolorapi.com). The available color schemes are monochromatic, analogous, complementary, near complementary (analogous-complementary), and triadic. Additionally, when you hover over a color, you can see its hex code, and when you click, it gets copied to your clipboard for easy color-picking when digital painting. Of course there are more robust color palette generators, such as color.adobe.com, but this starts with a completely random seed color.<br><br>
Note: This web app does NOT use artificial intelligence for the purpose of ai image generation, which is unethical due to theft. Rather it is using ai to spur human imagination to create real works of art.
